# DAY ONE

On the first day, I created a basic list and detailView app called Landscapes. 

It is inspired by Brian Advent's [iOS 13 Swift Tutorial: Simple SwiftUI Application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfw7zWxchQc&) and Paul Hudson's [SwiftUI Tutorial: Build a dynamic list app with navigation and images â€“ SwiftUI Complete Apps #1
